# Proper-Mobcap-Modifier
A simple mod to "properly" modify mobcaps

This mod just modifies SpawnGroup enum getters to get the values from config instead

Don't criticize me for bizarre fixes (like counting to hundred before trying to access the config to let it load) if you don't know another mod that just modifies the enum without touching the spawning logic :)
